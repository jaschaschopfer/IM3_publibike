# IM3_publibike
 This data visualization project shows the distribution of e-bikes and regular bikes across different elevation levels in Bern, tracking changes over time.
# Learnings
- How to connect to different endpoints of different APIs: Publibike API and elevation API
- Getting altitude of each single station in elevation API
- working with arrays and JSON files, en- and decoding from it
- loading to and unloading from our database
- separating the steps into different PHP files
- implementing libraries like chart.js, datepicker



# Schwierigkeiten
- CHATGPT VERLAUF ANSCHAUEN
- Filters of chart had to be defined explicitly to not get dropped after changing time or date values 
- Set default date and time in 15min intervall when page is loaded needed more effort than expected
- responsiveness of chart.js is difficult to understand: we could not get it to grow back when window gets big again after shrinking (not a usual usecase)
